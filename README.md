# cuedley
One more experiment with CUE to eventually express Wardley Map as Data

## WIP 

you can test the example by `cd example`
and run `go run .`


## Commands

so far, the only command is `cue genCheatSheet`

|Stage (of activity) | I | II | III | IV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|_Characteristics_|   |   |   |   |	
| certainty | Poorly understood | Rapid increases in learning | Rapid increases in use / fit for purpose | Commonly understood (in terms of use) |	
| publicationTypes | Normally describe the wonder of the thing | Build / construct / awarness and learning | Maintenance / operations / installation / feature | Focused on use |	
| ubiquity | Rare | Slowly increasing consumption | Rapidly increasing consumption | Widespread and stability |	
|_General Properties_|   |   |   |   |	
| comparison | Constantly changing / a differential / unstable | Learning from others / testing the water / some evidential support | Feature difference | Essential / operational advantage |	
| decisionDrivers | Heritage / culture | Analysis & synthesis | Analysys & synthesis | Previous experience |	
| efficiency | Reducing the cost of change (experimentation) | Reducing cost of waste (Learning) | Reducing cost of waste (Learning) | Reducing cost of deviation (Volume) |	
| failure | High / tolerated / assumed | Moderated / unsurprising but disapointed | Not tolerated, focus on constant improvement | Operational efficiency and surprised by failure |	
| focusOfValue | High future worth | Seeking profit / ROI? | High profitability | High volume / reducing margin |	
| knowledgeManagement | Uncertain | Learning on use | Learning on operation | known / accepted |	
| market | Undefined market | Forming market | Growing market | Mature market |	
| marketAction | Gambling / driven by gut | Exploring a 'found' value | Market analysis / listening to customers | Metric driven / build what is needed |	
| marketPerception | Chaotic (non-linear) | Domain of experts | Increasing expectations of use | Ordered (appearance of being linear) / trivial |	
| perceptionInIndustry | Competitive advantage / unpredicatble / unknown | Competitive advantage / ROI / case examples | Advantage through implementation / features | Cost of doing business / accepted |	
| understanding | Poorly understood / unpredictable | Increasing understanding / development of measures | Increasing education / constant refinement of needs / measures | Believed to be well defined / stable / measurable |	
| userPerception | Different / confusing / exciting / surprising | Leading edge / emerging | Common / disappointed if not used or available | Standard / expected |
